N Queens Puzzle Solver
Usage: nqueens N

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing
N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

This program solves the N queens problem and
prints every possible solution to the problem.

Arguments:
N: An integer greater or equal to 4 representing the size
of the chessboard and the number of queens.

If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
it prints "Usage: nqueens N" and exits with status 1.
If N is not an integer, it prints "N must be a number" and exits with status 1.
If N is smaller than 4, it prints "N must be at least 4"
and exits with status 1.
